h1.2. Create a Car class that has the methods: start(), accelerate(), stop(), getSpeed(), setSpeed(), startEngine(), stopEngine(). Which of them are private/public/protected? What are the attributes of the class? Extend the Car class to the MyCuteCar class, add a second rocket engine to it, and a method startRocketEngine(). Investigate the use of methods from Car in the MyCuteCar class. Investigate which methods from the Car and MyCuteCar classes can be accessible in main().<br>
h1.6. Design UML diagrams and write code/possible stub methods for the Person, Address, Teacher, Student, Course classes, and the following methods: addStudentToCourse, removeStudentFromCourse, addTeacherToCourse, RemoveTeacherFromCourse, changeTeacherAddress, ChangeStudentAddress, createNewCourse from list of students and teacher.<br>
h1.7. Write code/possible stub methods for the Person, Company, Employee, and Address classes. Actions: move Employee to another company, add employees to company, display addresses of all employees working for a company at a certain address, find a company by name and list all employees. <br>
h1.8. Design classes to reflect relations between: Person, Tourist, Hotel, Address, City. <br>
Implement the following actions: change address for a Hotel/Person/Tourist, Tourist moves to
another Hotel, get all hotels in a city, display all tourists in a city hotels, is a person accommodated in
some city hotels ? display all persons and tourists <br>
h1.9. UML Diagram <br>
h1.11. Write the code for the following classes. Create a Shape interface (color attribute and getPerimeter method). Extend the interface to the abstract class Shape2D (abstract method getArea) and Shape3D (abstract method getVolume). Implement Shape in the StraightLine class (a straight line in geometry). Extend Shape2D and Shape3D to Square, Circle, Sphere, and Cube. Make the necessary modifications to the class elements to display:<br>
<ul><li>The length of the straight line</li>
<li>Considering a list that contains squares and circles, calculate their perimeter</li>
<li>Considering a list that contains squares and circles, spheres and cubes, calculate their area</li>
<li>Considering a list that contains spheres and cubes, calculate their volume.</li></ul>
h1.13. Read a number x from a file and calculate the value 2*x. For any possible error, x has a default value of 1. Print the calculated value. Organize the code using exceptions, methods, and classes. <br>
h1.14. Modify Example 1.14 so that the user can repeat reading a numerical value until it is an integer.<br>
h1.15. Write an application that generates random integer numbers, denoted by x, and adds 100/x as elements of a data structure similar to an array. Return the respective data structure. Organize the code. Handle as many of the exceptions ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, Exception as possible.<br>
h1.19. Sort a list/vector/etc of Students (attributes name and grade) by the attribute grade. Do not write code to implement any of the known sorting methods (Quick, bubble, insert etc). <br>
h1.20. Calculate the sum of two numbers read from the keyboard. Use Exceptions and NULL. <br>
h1.24. Consider a file that can contain integers, floats, or any other strings. Write a class that calculates the sum of all integers in the file, ignoring all others. Handle exceptions.
